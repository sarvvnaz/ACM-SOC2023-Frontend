this is a short summary of what i learned about SEO and how apple uses it.

SEO stands for search engine optimization, which is the process of improving a website's visibility and relevance for search engines and users.

SEO helps websites to be recognized by Google by following certain guidelines.
websites use different strategies to be more recognizable
there are technical, on-site and off-site SEO.
in SEO both what the user sees(the actual pages) and what search engine sees(the code) matter.
these are some of the strategies that apple uses to increase its recognition by the search engines:
Optimizing the website for keywords that are relevant to its products, services, and brand:
For example, apple.com ranks for keywords like "apple", "apple store", "airpods", "apple tv", and "apple watch" 

also apple.com has a sitemap that lists all the pages on the website and helps Google discover new or updated content
Providing a great user experience that includes a responsive design, and a clear navigation with putting everything at sight and making finding what the user is looking for easier
Using title, URL, and description tags to draw high click-through-rate (CTR) in the search results.
For example, apple.com uses descriptive and catchy titles and descriptions that highlight its products and benefits

also one goal for better SEO is to publish helpful, high-quality content. this can be done by understanding the user's needs.


for example we can add meta code of keywords relevent to Airpods to get that webpage by searching bout airpoods.
keywords can be generated using Google Keyword Planner
<meta name="keywords" content="AirPods Pro, AirPods Pro review, AirPods Pro deals, best wireless earbuds, noise cancelling earbuds">
