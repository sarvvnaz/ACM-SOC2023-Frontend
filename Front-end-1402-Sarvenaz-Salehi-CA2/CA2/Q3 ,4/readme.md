I used my previous knowledge and what I learned in class for this project. i used bootstrap grids and @media for making the page responsive.
for the buttons and forms i used bootstrap and customized them by using chrome devtools. 
for the icons i used fontawsome.
this project helped alot with learning bootstrap and responsive design.
my main sources were bootstrap docs and stackoverflow.
